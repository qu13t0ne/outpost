## Description

Stand-alone self-hosting infrastructure with security and a range of apps. Caddy for reverse proxy plus generally heavy use of Docker. Easy and straightforward to add more services as need.

Build yourself an outpost.

*Repo URL: [https://github.com/qu13t0ne/outpost](https://github.com/qu13t0ne/outpost)*

* * * * *

## Components Overview

### Core Infrastructure & Security

- **[Caddy v2 Reverse Proxy](./caddy/)**
   - Including Caddy-Security for user authentication & MFA
   - *Note:* Be sure to read the [Important Reverse Proxy Setup Information](./caddy/readme.md#important-reverse-proxy-setup-information) in the [Caddy readme](./caddy/readme.md) file.

### Monitoring

- **[Portainer](./portainer)** - Lightweight Docker management web UI (mostly I just use for status monitoring)

### Databases

- **[Adminer](./adminer/)** - Database management web UI
- **[MongoDB](./mongodb/)** - MongoDB non-relational database
<!-- - **[PostgreSQL and pgAdmin](./postgres/)** -->

### Apps & Services

- **[Budibase](./budibase/)** - Low-code platform 
- **[CyberChef](./cyberchef/)** - Cyber Swiss Army Knife web app
- **[Flame Startpage](./flame/)** - Easy startpage and bookmarks page
- **[Nextcloud](./nextcloud)** - Flexible open source file synchronization and sharing solution
- **[PhotoPrism](./photoprism)** - Photos management app

## Installation and Setup

### Summary

1. **Prep your host system.**
2. **Follow startup instructions** on each of the component readme pages linked in the [Components Overview above](#components-overview).

### Prep Host System

Linux is preferred for a server. I tend to run Debian-based distros, but any Linux distro should work fine. Since stuff is mostly Docker-based, Outpost can also be run on a local workstation as `localhost`, including MacOS (partially tested) and theoretically Windows (if you *must*, not tested, some mods probably necessary). All setup and commands in this repo assume a Linux (Debian) host, so YMMV.

**Outline**
- [Filesystem Setup Notes](#filesystem-setup-notes)
   - [Optional NFS Considerations](#optional-nfs-considerations)
- [Install Docker](#install-docker)
- [Add Docker Daemon Settings](#add-docker-daemon-settings)
- [Create Docker Networks](#create-docker-networks)

#### Filesystem Setup Notes

It's general best practice to run any apps / functions on a separate partition than the root OS.
- *Option 1:* Partition the hard drive to separate `/` (root) and everything else. At minimum, if you blow through the available storage at least you haven't also crippled the operating system.
- *Option 2:* Mount a separate drive for data.
- *Option 3:* Mount a shared drive for data, e.g. using NFS. This has the added benefit of separating the data storage function onto a separate server from the apps / services function. But introduces extra complications. It's best suited for user files that need to be shared across systems, whereas databases are better saved on the local file system (e.g., `/srv`), then properly backed up

I've configured this project to default to *Option 2* above. The `/srv` directory is assumed to be on a separate drive from the OS. 
- Docker is configured (see *Docker Daemon Settings* below) to use `/srv/docker` as the default location for docker-related files (containers, volumes, logs, etc.) instead of the standard `/var/lib/docker`.
- Containers and services will by default save persistent data to various folders in `/srv`, as indicated in the `template-env` files.

##### Optional NFS Considerations

For using NFS to work:
1. The NFS server must enable the `all_squash` setting on the export.
2. The NFS client config must include the configuration options `user` (allow non-root user to mount) and `rw` (read-write).
3. Any user account that needs read-write access to the share, including system users leveraged by containers, must be added to the `nogroup` group
   ```
   sudo usermod -a -G nogroup <username>
   ```
4. Environment variables for data storage will need to be updated based on the relevant NFS share location on the **Outpost** host file system.

Individual services may have additional considerations when relying on NFS storage mounted to the host. These are documented in service readme files.

#### Install Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) according to the latest Docker instructions.

#### Add Docker Daemon Settings

Add some default settings to the Docker daemon for log rotation and container privilege restriction.

- Review contents of the [daemon.json](./daemon.json) file in this repo.
- Check if a default `daemon.json` file has already been created by Docker.
```shell
ls /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
- **IF** a default file does not exist (meaning the above command returns something like `ls: cannot access '/etc/docker/daemon.json': No such file or directory`), **THEN**:
	- Copy the `daemon.json` file from this repo to the default docker location
	```shell
	sudo cp ./daemon.json /etc/docker/daemon.json
	```
- **ELSE** (i.e., a file already exists at `/etc/docker/daemon.json`):
	- Modify the existing file to add the settings from this repo's version.

Finally, restart the Docker daemon.
```shell
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

### Create Docker Networks
Create two networks to use for Docker containers. One for the proxy service and one for databases. This allows some segregation of services, so only containers that need to be proxied are exposed to the proxy side of things and only containers that are shared databases or need access to them will have access to the db network.
``` 
docker network create proxy_net 
docker network create db_net
```
